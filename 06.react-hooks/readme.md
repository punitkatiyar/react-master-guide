# React Hooks 

**React Hooks are a set of functions that allow you to use state and other React features in functional components. Prior to the introduction of Hooks in React 16.8, state management and lifecycle methods were only available in class components. With Hooks, you can now use these features in functional components as well, making them more powerful and flexible.**

Some of the most commonly used Hooks are:

- <a href="./">useState</a>
- useEffect
- useContext
- useReducer
- useCallback
- useMemo
